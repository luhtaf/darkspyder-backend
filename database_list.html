                    In June 2023, the website of the large bank PrimSotsBank encountered an incident, as a result of which the data of about 90 thousand users got into the network. Emails, nicknames, full names, logins, as well as passwords in the form of an MD5 hash with salt were revealed.

                    In February 2017, it was discovered that a database from the Coachella music festival was being sold online. The data was supposedly taken from the main Coachella website and their message board. The published data included nearly 600 thousand usernames, IP addresses, email addresses, and salted password hashes (MD5 in the case of the message board).

                    There is a file on the network containing 8.4 million phones, as well as the names and regions of residence of their owners. Some sources claim that it was collected from Avito using parsing, while others claim that the source is the site bases-brothers.ru, which provided breakdowns by phone numbers. Thus, the exact origin of the leak remains unknown. The parsing dates back to approximately 2017.
